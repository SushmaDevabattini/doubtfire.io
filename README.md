## Project - Ontrack

## Ontrack 

OnTrack is a web assessment tool that provides students with a task oriented approach to portfolio assessment to stay aligned by completing tasks as part of their learning. Students will work through a series of tasks in order to achieve a target grade to complete their unit learning outcomes.

OnTrack helps students to achieve their learning outcomes by taking the focus away from grades and placing the importance on learning of the content delivered by the unit. Grades will not be allocated for tasks during the course of their learning, instead, their learning will be assessed using the learning outcomes at the end of the unit.

The above will be achieved by the summative assessments completed at the end of the unit, by determining student grades with the evidence they present in their portfolio. The portfolio will consist of work that the student complete as part of tasks assigned in the unit. These tasks are designed in order to help students learn and demonstrate their achievements as part of learning outcomes of a unit.
